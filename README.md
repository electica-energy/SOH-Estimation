# SOH-Estimation

Here’s the **complete rewritten and professionally formatted one-pager** for your submission — incorporating your aim, flow, GitHub link, and the improved section describing the AI model (without disclosing its internal name).



# **Electica Energy – Battery Intelligence Prototype**

## **Aim**

To demonstrate the predictive intelligence of ElecticaOS by analyzing real-world battery life cycle data and accurately estimating the State of Health (SOH), performance trends, and degradation patterns over time. The objective is to showcase how AI-driven analytics can transform raw battery data into actionable insights for improved lifespan, safety, and efficiency.



## **Input**

1. Upload battery life cycle data containing parameters such as **voltage, current, and temperature**.
2. The dataset should include multiple **charge–discharge cycles** to ensure accurate pattern recognition and trend analysis.
3. The platform supports both **single-cell and pack-level datasets** in standard CSV or JSON formats.



## **Process**

Once the data is uploaded, the system processes it through an **AI-powered, neural network–based machine learning model** designed specifically for energy systems. This model integrates deep-physics learning with real-world electrochemical data to identify degradation patterns and predict future performance.

The model dynamically learns how **temperature, voltage, and current** interact with capacity fade and internal resistance across cycles. It then produces accurate State of Health (SOH) estimations while detecting early-stage anomalies that conventional battery management systems cannot capture.

All results are visualized through an **interactive analytics dashboard**, enabling users to view SOH prediction curves, temperature and voltage trends, correlation heatmaps, and degradation evolution across cycles — providing a complete digital twin of the battery’s behavior.



## **Output**

The software generates the following analytical outputs:
• **Predicted and accurate State of Health (SOH)** of the battery.
• **Performance trends** over time, including temperature, voltage, and current variations.
• **SOH distribution curve** showing the spread of battery health across cycles.
• **Correlation heatmap** between all major parameters.
• **SOH vs. Cycle curve** illustrating health degradation during the operational period.
